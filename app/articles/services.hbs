    <p>In the last seven years, Final has invested in fully understanding NinjaTrader platform capabilities, and developed a technology that maximizes the NinjaTrader technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the outstanding NinjaTraders platform features is that because the platform is open, professional programmers can easily customize the application using standard C# code and libraries. This  provides an un-matched level of customization when developing studies for the platform.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the years we programmed hundreds of indicators and automatic strategies for individual traders and hedge funds. In addition, because our programmers are also accomplished traders and communicate daily with other traders, Final has an inside understanding of how the market works, and how different users approach the market.</p>
      <h3>Sample programming work for NinjaTrader include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatic Strategies.</li>
        <li>Custom Indicators.</li>
        <li>Market Analyzer Studies.</li>
